Where to start?
---------------

First, you should have a look at :ref:`Requirements` to setup a CCF-compatible environment. Then, you will be able to build CCF from sources and run the tests (see :ref:`Building CCF`). Note that you can run a `virtual` CCF that does not require Intel SGX for rapid prototyping.

Once this is done, you will be able to, in that order:

1. Create a consortium and agree on the constitution. See :ref:`Member Governance`;
2. Develop a CCF application, or use the sample logging :ref:`Example App`;
3. Start a new CCF network to deploy the application. See :ref:`Starting a New Network`;
4. Let the consortium configure and open the network to users. See :ref:`Opening a Network`;
5. Have users issue business transactions to the application. See :ref:`Using CCF Applications`.
