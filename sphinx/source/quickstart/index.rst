Quickstart
==========

.. warning:: TODO - Quickstart with vscode and container

First, you should have a look at :ref:`Requirements` to setup a CCF-compatible environment. Then, you will be able to build CCF from sources and run the tests (see :ref:`Building CCF`). Note that for rapid prototyping, you can run a `virtual` build of CCF that does not require Intel SGX.


Once this is done, make sure you are familiar with some of :ref:`CCF concepts`. You will then be able to:

1. Create a consortium and agree on the constitution. See :ref:`Member Governance`
2. Develop a CCF application. See :ref:`Example App`
3. Start a new CCF network to deploy the application. See :ref:`Starting a New Network`
4. Let the consortium configure and open the network to users. See :ref:`Opening a Network`
5. Have users issue business transactions to the application. See :ref:`Using CCF Applications`
